## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes **2023 revenue performance** and builds a **2024 revenue forecast** for a Kleinanzeigen-style classifieds platform.

The analysis uses four core tables:

- `Accounts.csv` – customer accounts & hierarchy  
- `Contracts.csv` – contract type and lifecycle  
- `Services.csv` – service subscriptions, product types, termination reasons  
- `Invoices.csv` – monthly invoice revenue & billing periods  

The goal is to answer:

1. **How did revenue and customer activity develop in 2023?**  
2. **Which product types drive revenue?**  
3. **What is the expected monthly revenue for 2024?**
